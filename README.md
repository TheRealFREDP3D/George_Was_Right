George-was-Right-v2 leverages a team of AI agents, powered by CrewAI, to analyze recent world events through the lens of themes from George Orwell's *1984*. It orchestrates four specialized agents—Researcher, Writer, Illustrator, and Editor—to perform tasks such as:

- Searching for relevant news.
- Comparing news with themes from *1984*.
- Writing articles.
- Generating illustration prompts to accompany analyses.

This project aims to provide a nuanced examination of how contemporary society reflects Orwellian concerns about digital privacy and freedom, fostering meaningful discussion and awareness.

## Project History

This is the second iteration of George-was-Right. The original version, a simple Python project, became unmanageable due to accumulating changes and a lack of version control. Starting fresh enabled a focus on better coding practices, structured development, and Git-based version control.

### Lessons Learned

- Importance of planning and incremental development.
- Effective use of Git for managing changes.
- Best practices for Python project structuring and imports.
- Benefits of regular backups and separating development from production environments.
