**Two Sets of Prompts:**

**Prompt 1: Recent Event - Disruption of Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Campaigns**

Create an illustration of a dark and ominous digital landscape, representing the covert Russian government-sponsored foreign malign influence campaigns. The setting should be a futuristic, high-tech environment with rows of computer servers, wires, and screens displaying propaganda messages. In the center of the illustration, depict a large, cracked screen with a bold, red "DISRUPTED" stamp across it, symbolizing the Justice Department's successful disruption of the campaigns.

In the background, include subtle hints of the Russian government's involvement, such as a faint image of the Kremlin or a Russian flag. The mood should be tense and foreboding, conveying the sense of unease and danger that comes with government manipulation of information.

**Prompt 2: '1984' Theme - Government Manipulation of Information and Propaganda**

Create an illustration of a dystopian society inspired by Orwell's '1984', featuring a massive, imposing structure representing the Ministry of Truth. The building should be surrounded by propaganda posters and screens displaying messages of government control and manipulation. In the foreground, depict a group of citizens in uniform, their faces expressionless and conformist, as they gaze up at the towering structure.

At the top of the illustration, include a large, ominous screen displaying the image of Big Brother, symbolizing the all-pervasive surveillance and control of the totalitarian government. The mood should be dark and foreboding, conveying the sense of oppression and hopelessness that pervades the novel.
