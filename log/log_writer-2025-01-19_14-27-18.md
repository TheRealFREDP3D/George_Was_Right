### **Big Brother in the 21st Century: The Alarming Parallels Between Orwell's *1984* and Modern-Day Surveillance**

In George Orwell's *1984*, the omnipresent figure of Big Brother looms large, symbolizing a government that monitors every aspect of its citizens' lives. The novel's chilling depiction of a surveillance state has become a cultural touchstone, warning against the dangers of unchecked government power. Today, Orwell's vision feels less like fiction and more like a prescient analysis of our current reality. Recent news events, such as the sharp rise in the unmasking of U.S. identities in surveillance reports by the National Security Agency (N.S.A.), underscore the continued relevance of *1984* in understanding the balance between security and privacy.

#### **The News Event: A Surge in Surveillance**

On April 30, 2024, The New York Times reported a significant increase in the unmasking of U.S. identities in surveillance reports by the N.S.A. This practice, known as "unmasking," involves revealing the identities of individuals who were incidentally caught in surveillance operations. While such measures are often justified as necessary for national security, the sharp rise in disclosures has raised concerns about privacy violations and government overreach. Critics argue that the lack of transparency and oversight in these practices mirrors the encroachment of an Orwellian surveillance state.

#### **The Theme from *1984*: Big Brother and Pervasive Surveillance**

In *1984*, Orwell introduces the concept of Big Brother, the all-seeing leader of the Party who uses advanced surveillance technologies to monitor and control citizens. Telescreens, hidden microphones, and informants ensure that no action or thought goes unnoticed. The Party's surveillance apparatus is not just a tool for gathering information but also a means of instilling fear and maintaining power. The novel's famous slogan, "Big Brother is watching you," encapsulates the loss of privacy and autonomy in a society where surveillance is absolute.

#### **Parallels Between Fiction and Reality**

The N.S.A.'s practices bear an unsettling resemblance to Orwell's vision of a surveillance state. While modern governments may not employ telescreens, the pervasive use of advanced technologies—such as facial recognition, phone tapping, and data collection—achieves a similar effect. Just as the Party in *1984* justifies its surveillance in the name of security and stability, contemporary governments often invoke national security to defend intrusive practices. However, the lack of accountability and transparency in these operations raises questions about the potential for abuse.

One key difference lies in the scale and intent of surveillance. In *1984*, the Party's goal is absolute control, extending even to the thoughts of its citizens. Modern surveillance, while extensive, is often framed as a tool for combating terrorism, crime, and other societal threats. Yet, the potential for misuse remains a significant concern. The line between protection and oppression is perilously thin, and the erosion of privacy rights can pave the way for authoritarianism.

#### **Why This Event Matters**

The N.S.A.'s increased unmasking of U.S. identities serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance in safeguarding democratic freedoms. Orwell's *1984* is not merely a cautionary tale but a blueprint for understanding the dangers of unchecked power. The parallels between the novel and modern surveillance practices highlight the need for robust oversight, transparency, and public discourse to prevent the slide into authoritarianism.

As we navigate the complexities of a digital age, Orwell's warnings about the loss of privacy and autonomy remain as relevant as ever. The question is not whether Big Brother is watching but how closely—and what we are willing to do to protect our freedoms.
