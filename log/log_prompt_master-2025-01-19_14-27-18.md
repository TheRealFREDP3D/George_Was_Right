### **Two Sets of Prompts for Illustrations**  

---

### **Set 1: Recent Event - Surge in Surveillance**  

#### **Prompt 1: The Unmasking Surge**  
"Create an illustration of a modern government surveillance office, filled with glowing monitors displaying fragmented images of people's faces, phone calls, and digital data streams. In the foreground, a shadowy figure in a suit observes the screens with a neutral but imposing expression. The setting should feel cold and impersonal, with a sterile, metallic color palette. Include subtle symbols of privacy invasion, such as an eye-shaped logo on the walls and documents labeled 'Unmasking Protocol.' The mood should evoke unease and the tension between security and personal freedom."  

#### **Prompt 2: Citizens Under Watch**  
"Illustrate a bustling city street where citizens go about their daily lives, unaware of the surveillance cameras perched on every corner, their red recording lights glowing ominously. In the background, a massive digital billboard displays the phrase 'For Your Safety' alongside an abstract eye symbol. The mood should be a mix of normalcy and quiet paranoia, with muted tones and subtle shadows cast by the cameras. Show a few individuals glancing nervously at the cameras, hinting at their awareness of being watched."

### **Set 2: *1984* Theme - Big Brother and Pervasive Surveillance**  

#### **Prompt 1: The Ministry of Truth**  
"Illustrate the Ministry of Truth as a towering, oppressive building with no windows, its surface cold and featureless except for a massive banner displaying the face of Big Brother and the slogan 'War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength.' The foreground should show a group of workers in identical gray uniforms entering the building, their heads bowed. The atmosphere should feel heavy and foreboding, with dark clouds looming overhead and a stark, monochromatic color scheme."  

#### **Prompt 2: The Telescreen Room**  
"Create an illustration of a dimly lit, claustrophobic room dominated by a giant telescreen displaying Big Brother's face. The screen's glow casts harsh shadows on the walls, which are lined with propaganda posters. In the room, a lone individual sits at a small desk, their back to the viewer, typing on a typewriter. The mood should feel oppressive and isolating, with a limited color palette of grays and blues. Include subtle details like a clock stuck at 13:00 and a small camera lens embedded in the telescreen, emphasizing constant surveillance."
