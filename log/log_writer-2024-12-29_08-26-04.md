The theme of surveillance in '1984' is particularly relevant today, as evidenced by the Chinese government's implementation of a sophisticated system of internet censorship, known as the "Great Firewall," which blocks access to certain websites and monitors online activity.

Here is a small article that includes a detailed comparison of the selected news event and the theme from '1984':

Title: The Great Firewall of China: A Real-World Example of Orwell's Surveillance State

Introduction

George Orwell's classic dystopian novel, '1984', depicts a totalitarian society where the government exercises total control over its citizens, monitoring their every move and thought. One of the key themes of the book is surveillance, and how it is used to maintain control and suppress dissent. In recent years, China has implemented a sophisticated system of internet censorship, known as the "Great Firewall," which blocks access to certain websites and monitors online activity. This development has striking similarities to the surveillance state depicted in '1984', and highlights the ongoing relevance of Orwell's warnings about the dangers of government control.

The Great Firewall of China

The Great Firewall of China is a complex system of internet censorship that blocks access to certain websites and monitors online activity. It was first implemented in the late 1990s, and has since become one of the most sophisticated systems of internet censorship in the world. The system uses a combination of techniques, including IP blocking, DNS tampering, and keyword filtering, to block access to websites that are deemed to be a threat to the Chinese government. This includes websites that promote democracy, human rights, and freedom of speech, as well as those that provide access to information that is critical of the government.

Comparison to '1984'

The Great Firewall of China has striking similarities to the surveillance state depicted in '1984'. In the book, the government exercises total control over its citizens, monitoring their every move and thought. The telescreen, a device that serves as both a television and a surveillance camera, is a ubiquitous presence in every home, allowing the government to monitor its citizens at all times. Similarly, the Great Firewall of China allows the government to monitor online activity, blocking access to websites that are deemed to be a threat to its authority.

Conclusion

The Great Firewall of China is a real-world example of the surveillance state depicted in '1984'. It highlights the ongoing relevance of Orwell's warnings about the dangers of government control, and the importance of protecting freedom of speech and access to information. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that governments will continue to use surveillance as a means of maintaining control and suppressing dissent. It is therefore essential that we remain vigilant, and continue to fight for our rights to freedom of speech and access to information.
