### Recent Event Illustration Prompt:  
**Prompt Title: "The Shadow of Hikvision: Surveillance in the Modern World"**  
Create a digital illustration capturing the essence of the Hikvision surveillance scandal. The scene should depict a bustling urban environment, such as a modern city square, filled with diverse individuals going about their day. Above them, surveillance cameras are omnipresent—mounted on streetlights, buildings, and drones hovering in the sky. The cameras should have a menacing, almost sentient quality, with glowing red lenses to symbolize their invasive nature.  

In the background, include a large digital billboard displaying a map with highlighted regions under surveillance, subtly referencing areas like Xinjiang. The mood should be tense and unsettling, emphasizing the theme of constant monitoring and the erosion of privacy. Use a realistic art style with a muted color palette dominated by grays and blues, punctuated by the red glow of the cameras. Add subtle visual elements, such as people nervously glancing at the cameras or covering their faces, to convey the unease and fear of being watched.

### '1984' Theme Illustration Prompt:  
**Prompt Title: "Big Brother’s Gaze: The Dystopian Future"**  
Illustrate a dystopian scene inspired by George Orwell's "1984," focusing on the theme of authoritarian surveillance. The composition should feature a towering, ominous building resembling a government headquarters, with a massive screen displaying the face of Big Brother. The screen should dominate the scene, casting an eerie, bluish glow over the surroundings.  

Below the screen, a crowd of people stands in rigid formation, their faces blank and devoid of individuality, symbolizing conformity and fear. Surrounding the crowd are telescreens and loudspeakers mounted on poles, blaring propaganda slogans like "War is Peace" and "Freedom is Slavery." The environment should feel oppressive, with dark clouds looming overhead and shadows engulfing the edges of the illustration.  

Use a surreal art style with exaggerated perspectives to heighten the sense of unease. The color palette should be dark and muted, with shades of gray, black, and deep blue, contrasted by the bright, artificial glow of the telescreens. Include subtle details, such as cracks in the pavement or graffiti that says "Down with Big Brother," to hint at underlying resistance amidst the oppression.
