### Set 2: '1984' Theme - Big Brother  

**Prompt Title:** *"The Shadow of Big Brother"*  

- **Visual Concept:** A dark, dystopian cityscape dominated by a colossal propaganda poster of Big Brother’s face. The poster is weathered but omnipresent, with the words "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU" emblazoned in bold, stark lettering.  
- **Central Element:** A massive telescreen in the center of the city square, broadcasting the Party’s slogans: "War is Peace," "Freedom is Slavery," and "Ignorance is Strength." The screen emits a harsh, white glow that illuminates the surrounding area, casting long, ominous shadows.  
- **Foreground Details:** A crowd of people standing motionless, their faces expressionless and eyes vacant, symbolizing the erasure of individuality and the climate of fear. Some individuals are depicted with Thought Police uniforms lurking in the background, watching the crowd.  
- **Background Details:** A bleak, industrial skyline with smokestacks billowing black smoke, reinforcing the oppressive atmosphere. Hidden surveillance cameras and microphones are subtly integrated into the environment, peeking out from lampposts and walls.  
- **Color Palette:** A muted palette of grays, blacks, and browns, with occasional splashes of red to signify control and danger. The telescreen’s glow introduces stark contrasts of white light and deep shadows.  
- **Mood:** Menacing, oppressive, and foreboding, capturing the essence of a totalitarian regime.  
- **Style:** Gritty and dystopian, with a focus on texture and realism to immerse the viewer in Orwell’s world.  

These two sets of prompts are designed to visually encapsulate the themes of surveillance, control, and the erosion of individuality, drawing clear parallels between the modern surveillance state and Orwell’s *1984*.
