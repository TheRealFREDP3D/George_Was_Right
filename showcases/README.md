## Content

I put here the final content coming from the `main.py` execution.

### Text Output

`terminal_log': Raw, unedited terminal output (`verbose=True`)

*.jpg: I took the prompts generated by the `Illustrator` agent and use them to generate the picture (ChatGPT and Dall-E). I didn't changed a single letter of the prompts (Copy/Paste).
