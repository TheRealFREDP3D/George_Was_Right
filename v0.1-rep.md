# Change Summary - v0.1 Refactoring

## Fixed Issues
1. **Missing import fix**: Added missing `use_fallback` import in main.py
2. **Error handling improvements**: Enhanced error logs with more detailed information
3. **LLM fallback mechanism**: Improved the fallback logic when Ollama connection fails
4. **Resource management**: Added cleanup function to properly release resources
5. **Exit code handling**: Updated main execution to return proper exit codes

## Current Status
The application is still experiencing connection issues with Ollama. Error logs show:
- `litellm.APIConnectionError: OllamaException - [Errno 111] Connection refused`
- `litellm.APIConnectionError: OllamaException - [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address`

These errors indicate that the Ollama service is either not running or not accessible from the current environment.

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing alternative LLM providers that don't require local installation
2. Add more comprehensive fallback mechanisms to handle service unavailability
3. Implement proper configuration validation to check service accessibility before attempting operations
4. Add clear user guidance for setting up required services
