Here are the two sets of illustration prompts for both contexts:

**Set 1: 1984 Illustration Prompts**

1. Telescreen Tangle: Depict a sprawling network of telescreens, monitoring every move and thought, with Winston Smith's face in the center, symbolizing the all-seeing eye of Big Brother.
2. Ministry of Truth Maze: Illustrate a labyrinthine corridor with Ministry of Truth propaganda posters plastered on the walls, leading to a massive, stone-cold statue of the Party's emblem, with Winston Smith trapped in the background, rewriting history.
3. Doublethink Dilemma: Portray a split-personality illustration of Winston Smith, with one side conforming to the Party's ideology and the other side seeking autonomy, with the slogan "Freedom is Slavery" hovering above.
4. Memory Hole Abyss: Envision a dark, swirling vortex, with fragments of historical documents, photographs, and artifacts being consumed by the void, while Winston Smith reaches out to grasp a disappearing memory.

**Set 2: Modern Surveillance Illustration Prompts**

1. Panopticon Cityscape: Illustrate a metropolitan skyline with towering surveillance cameras, drones, and Facial Recognition billboards, with citizens trapped in a transparent dome, symbolizing the all-seeing eye of modern surveillance.
2. Social Media Trap: Depict a person ensnared in a web of social media threads, with likes, shares, and comments morphing into chains, as corporations and governments lurk in the shadows, extracting personal data.
3. Digital Doublethink: Portray a smartphone screen displaying a newsfeed with contradictory headlines, fake news, and alternative facts, with a person's reflection trapped in the screen, symbolizing the blurred lines between truth and fiction.
4. Data Dumpster: Envision a massive, overflowing trash can labeled "Personal Data," with people's online activities, passwords, and identities scattered around, as corporations and governments rummage through the digital waste.

These illustration prompts aim to visually connect the themes of surveillance, social control, and misinformation in both Orwell's 1984 and modern society, highlighting the urgent need for vigilance and critical thinking in the face of mounting threats to our freedom and individuality.
