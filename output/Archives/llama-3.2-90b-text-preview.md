I have two sets of illustration prompts, one for the news event and one for the '1984' theme.

**Set 1 Illustration Prompts - "Facial Recognition and the Detroit Police Department"**

Prompt 1: "Wrongful Arrest"
Illustrate a scene of a person being mistakenly identified by facial recognition technology, leading to their arrest. The facial recognition software should be displayed on a police monitor, with the incorrect match highlighted. The person should be shown in handcuffs, looking confused and frightened. In the background, a blurred-out cityscape of Detroit should be visible.

Prompt 2: "Lack of Human Oversight"
Draw a crowded police control room with multiple monitors displaying facial recognition matches. However, the police officers are too distracted or overwhelmed to scrutinize the matches carefully. Illustrate a particular officer, who is the only one paying attention, looking concerned and questioning the accuracy of the match.

Prompt 3: "Surveillance State"
Illustrate a city street in Detroit with multiple surveillance cameras and facial recognition-enabled streetlights. A person should be shown walking down the street, unaware of the all-pervasive surveillance. The atmosphere should be ominous, with the cameras and lights looming over the person like sentinels.

Prompt 4: "Community Impact"
Draw a community meeting where people are discussing the use of facial recognition technology by the police department. Some community members should be shown expressing concerns about wrongful arrests and racial bias, while others should be shown supporting the use of the technology for public safety. The atmosphere should be tense, with a sense of unease and uncertainty.

**Set 2 Illustration Prompts - "1984: Telescreens and the Thought Police"**

Prompt 1: "Telescreen Surveillance"
Illustrate a scene of Winston Smith sitting in his apartment, with a telescreen monitoring his every move. The telescreen should be displaying a propaganda message, while Winston should be shown looking anxious and trying to avoid detection. In the background, a cityscape of Airstrip One should be visible.

Prompt 2: "Thought Police Patrol"
Draw a scene of Thought Police officers patrolling the streets, looking for anyone who might be thinking rebellious thoughts. They should be shown wearing distinctive uniforms and carrying futuristic equipment. A person should be shown in the background, trying to avoid eye contact and acting suspiciously.

Prompt 3: "Doublethink and Censorship"
Illustrate a scene of a person trying to think critically and write down rebellious thoughts, but the telescreen is monitoring their every move. The person should be shown trying to hide their writing, while the telescreen displays a message warning against "thoughtcrime."

Prompt 4: "Resistance and Secret Meeting"
Draw a scene of Winston Smith and Julia secretly meeting in a hidden location, trying to organize resistance against the Party. The atmosphere should be tense, with a sense of danger and urgency. The telescreen should be shown in the background, displaying a propaganda message.
