Two sets of illustration prompts: one for the news event and one for the '1984' theme

Set 1: Facial Recognition Technology News Event

**Prompt 1: "Surveillance State"**
Illustrate a cityscape with people walking in the background, unaware that their faces are being scanned by cameras mounted on buildings and streetlights. Show the faces of these individuals appearing on a large screen in a police control room, with their personal information and location data displayed alongside. In the foreground, depict a person trying to cover their face with a hoodie or mask, symbolizing the futile attempt to maintain anonymity in a world of pervasive surveillance.

**Prompt 2: "Misidentification"**
Create an illustration that shows a person being wrongly identified by facial recognition technology. Depict a law enforcement officer approaching the individual, who looks shocked and fearful, as the officer's tablet displays the incorrect information. The background can show a blurred image of a crime scene, with the person in the foreground highlighted in a red circle, indicating the incorrect identification. This illustration should convey the sense of unease and confusion that can arise from faulty technology.

**Prompt 3: "Vigilantism"**
Illustrate a group of people gathered around a public display of 'most wanted' individuals, created using facial recognition technology. Show some onlookers pointing fingers and judging the displayed individuals, with a mob-like atmosphere emerging in the crowd. This should represent the fear of public shaming and stigma that can come from being (mis)identified as a suspect. Incorporate blurred facial features in the background crowd, while focusing on the faces of those displayed, highlighting the stark difference between those deemed 'suspicious' and the rest.

Set 2: Similar Event or Theme from '1984'

**Prompt 1: "Telescreen Intrusion"**
Illustrate a close-up of a Telescreen mounted on a wall, with a family sitting in the background, huddled together in a defensive position. Depict a stern, authoritarian face appearing on the Telescreen, gazing directly into the room, with the message "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU" flashing on the screen's lower edge. Emphasize the sense of claustrophobia and the feeling that even the most personal spaces are not secure.

**Prompt 2: "Watching the Watchers"**
Depict a cityscape with numerous Telescreens mounted on buildings, broadcasting propaganda messages to the citizens below. However, subtly reveal that the Telescreens are also being observed by shadowy figures in the background, suggesting an inner circle of invigilators. Showcase how surveillance breeds more surveillance, perpetuating an atmosphere of fear and distrust. Use contrasting color palettes to create a sense of foreboding.

**Prompt 3: "Escape Illusion"**
Create an illustration where a person is trying to 'hide' from a Telescreen, by walking away from it or turning their head, but their reflection still appears in the screen's display. Represent the illusorily safe 'safe zones' outside the line of sight, emphasizing the paradox of hoping for freedom within a completely surveilled world. This could show broken reflective surfaces, reflections in puddles, or ambient lighting 'bleeding' into unauthorized surveillance zones, perpetuating a sense of living under perpetual scrutiny.

Both sets of illustrations will help exhibit the sense of omnipresent surveillance, both contemporary and fictional, highlighting the fears, mistrust, and collective anxiety the events evoke.
