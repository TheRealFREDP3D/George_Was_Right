Here are the two sets of illustration prompts:

2. "Algorithmic Echo Chamber": A depiction of a person trapped in a never-ending social media loop, with algorithms feeding them tailored information and opinions, as the world outside is obscured by a digital haze.
3. "Location, Location, Location": A visualization of a cityscape with GPS tracking signals crisscrossing the sky, highlighting the constant monitoring of citizens' movements.
4. "The Watchful Eye": A stylized illustration of a smartphone with an all-seeing eye in place of the camera lens, symbolizing the constant surveillance of personal devices.

**Set 2: '1984' Inspired Illustrations**

1. "Big Brother's Gaze": A haunting portrait of Big Brother's face on a giant telescreen, with citizens going about their daily lives under the watchful eye of the totalitarian government.
2. "Ministry of Truth": An illustration of the Ministry of Truth building, with propaganda posters and doublespeak slogans plastered on the walls, as a citizen in the foreground looks on in confusion.
3. "Thoughtcrime": A depiction of a person being dragged away by the Thought Police, surrounded by torn pages from a diary and scattered ideas, highlighting the dangers of independent thought.
4. "Room 101": A dark, ominous illustration of a person trapped in Room 101, surrounded by rats and the looming presence of Big Brother, symbolizing the ultimate fear of the totalitarian state.

These two sets of illustration prompts aim to visually connect the themes of modern surveillance to the classic dystopian novel '1984', highlighting the parallels between the two and sparking important conversations about the role of technology and government control in our lives.
