Sets up a project using AI agents for analyzing current news events through the lens of George Orwell's novel *1984*.

### Overview

The script is a part of a larger application that collaborates specialized AI agents to process tasks related to real-world news and *1984* themes.

### Key Components

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - It uses `dotenv` to load environment variables ensuring that sensitive information (like API keys or model names) is kept outside the code.

2. **Environment Validation**:
   - The `validate_environment` function checks if the necessary environment variables (`LLM_MODEL_NAME` and `PLANNING_LLM_NAME`) are set. If not, it raises an `EnvironmentError`.

3. **AI Agent Classes**:
   - **ResearcherAgent**: This agent is responsible for finding news articles relevant to *1984* themes. It requires a `search_tool` to perform its duties.
   - **WriterAgent**: It collects and writes about news events related to Orwell's *1984* themes.
   - **PromptMasterAgent**: This agent creates visual prompts meant to generate illustrations relating to the provided themes.

4. **Task Creation**:
   - The `create_tasks` function sets up tasks specific to each agent, like searching for news (Researcher), writing an article (Writer), and generating prompts (Prompt Master).

5. **Crew Creation**:
   - The `create_crew` function initializes instances of each agent along with their tasks, and packages them into a `Crew` object. This crew is set to handle the tasks concurrently with verbose logging enabled.

6. **Main Execution**:
   - When executed, it validates the environment, creates a crew of agents, and starts the task execution with `crew.kickoff()`. The script logs and prints out relevant model details before and after completion of the tasks.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks is utilized to catch and log exceptions that occur during crew creation and application execution.

This setup allows for a modular, scalable approach to analyze data with specialized agents handling distinct tasks, leveraging AI's capabilities to synthesize and analyze information related to thematic literature.
