### Sequence Diagram

To provide a sequence diagram for the `main.py`, let's focus on the interaction between the main function and the crew creation and kickoff process.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as "main.py"
    participant Function as "create_crew()"
    participant Agent as Agents
    participant Crew as Crew

    Main->>Function: create_crew()
    Function->>Agent: Initialize ResearcherAgent
    Function->>Agent: Initialize WriterAgent
    Function->>Agent: Initialize IllustratorAgent
    Function->>Crew: Return Crew with agents and tasks
    Main->>Crew: kickoff()
    Crew->>Main: Return result
    Main->>Main: print(result)
```
