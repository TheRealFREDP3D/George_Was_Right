## Introduction

This code is setting up a team of *AI agents* for a project aimed at analyzing modern-day news events in the context of themes from *George Orwell*'s novel "*1984*". The project involves several steps including setting up the environment, defining agent roles, creating a crew, and executing tasks.

## Code Explanation

Here's a *step-by-step* explanation of what's happening:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - It begins by importing necessary libraries and tools such as `os`, `dotenv`, and modules from `crewai` and `crewai_tools`.
   - The environment variables are loaded using `dotenv.load_dotenv()`.

2. **Agent Definitions**:
   - Three classes (`ResearcherAgent`, `WriterAgent`, `IllustratorAgent`) are defined, each extending from the base `Agent` class. These classes are specialized roles with specific goals and backstories:
     - **ResearcherAgent**: Focuses on researching real-world news and comparing them with themes from "1984".
     - **WriterAgent**: Gathers news events and writes about how they relate to Orwell's novel.
     - **IllustratorAgent**: Creates visual representations based on prompts.

3. **Crew Creation**:
   - The function `create_crew()` is responsible for setting up the agents using an LLM model specified as `ollama/llama3.1:latest` and the `SerperDevTool`.
   - Four tasks are defined:
     - Searching for news relevant to "1984" themes.
     - Writing an article comparing news events with themes from "1984".
     - Creating illustration prompts for both news events and "1984".
     - Developing visual concepts from those prompts.
   - A `Crew` is instantiated to manage these agents and tasks, and is set to process tasks sequentially.

4. **Main Function**:
   - The `main()` function executes the project. It creates the `Crew` and starts the kickoff process which runs all the defined tasks.
   - Upon completion, a message indicating the job is done, along with the result, is printed to the console.
