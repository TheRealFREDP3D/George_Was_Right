## File Overview

### Summary

`start.py` is a Python script designed to help manage environment variables saved in `.env` for a project. It provides a simple text-based user interface (TUI) that allows you to view, edit, add, delete, and save environment variables stored in a `.env` file. Additionally, it can execute another script called `main.py`.

---

### Key Features

1. **Environment Variables Management**: Load, view, edit, add, and delete environment variables.
2. **Backup Functionality**: Before saving changes to the `.env` file, it creates a backup of the current file named `.env.bak`.
3. **User Feedback**: Provides clear messages indicating the outcome of actions such as saving or executing scripts.
4. **Execution of Main Script**: Can run the `main.py` script from within the TUI.

### How It Works

**Initialization**
- The script starts by importing necessary libraries (`os`, `rich`, etc.) and initializes a Rich Console object for better formatted console output.

**Loading Environment Variables**
- The `load_env_file()` function reads either the `.env` or `.env.example` file based on which one is available.
- It skips lines that are empty or start with spaces, tabs (`#`), newlines (`\n`) because these are typically comments or not meant to be environment variables.

**Saving Environment Variables**
- The `save_env_file()` function writes the list of valid environment variable lines back into the `.env` file.
- Before overwriting the existing `.env` file, it creates a backup named `.env.bak`.

**User Interface (TUI)**
- A while loop runs continuously until the user decides to exit.
- Inside this loop:
  - The screen is cleared using `clear_screen()`.
  - A table displaying all current environment variables is printed using Rich Table formatting.
  - Users are provided with options to:
    - Edit an existing line
    - Add a new line
    - Delete an existing line
    - Save changes made to environment variables
    - Execute another script (`main.py`)
    - Exit the application

**User Input Handling**
- Based on user input:
  - If users choose an option like editing or adding lines, they are prompted further for details.
  - Errors such as invalid line numbers are caught and handled gracefully with user-friendly error messages.

**Execution of Main Script**
- Choosing option 5 will execute `main.py`. This could be any other Python script that relies on the configured environment variables defined in your `.env` file.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Script**: Execute `start.py`. You can do this by running `python start.py` in your terminal/command prompt after navigating to your project directory containing both scripts.
2. **Navigate Options**: Use numbers (1 through 6) to select different actions in the menu.
3. **Edit Environment Variables**: Choose appropriate options (1-3) to modify your environment variables as needed.
4. **Save Changes**: Remember to save changes before exiting if you've made modifications (option 4).
5. **Execute Main Script**: If you want to run your main application using updated settings from your `.env`, use option 5.

## Conclusion

This document should provide anyone using this script with a clear understanding of its functionality and how to use it effectively for their project.
