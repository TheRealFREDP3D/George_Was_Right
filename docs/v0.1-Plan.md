# George-Was-Right - File Description

This project is an intelligent agent system that involves various types of agents and tasks, utilizing large language models (LLMs) through an API. Here is a high-level overview of each component based on the provided information:

**agents.py**

* `agentFactory()`: A factory function used to create different types of agents, such as:
  * `researcherAgent`
  * `writerAgent`
  * `illustratorAgent`
  * `editorAgent`
This allows for easier instantiation and customization of agent types.

**main.py**

* The main entry point of the application, where you would orchestrate the interaction between agents, tasks, and tools.

**llm.py**

* `API Provider`: Connects to the LLM API.
* `LLM model`: The actual large language model used for processing tasks and generating responses.
* `Base_Url`: The base URL for the LLM API.
* `API Key`: An API key for authentication and accessing the LLM service.

**tasks.py**

* `researchTask`: A task related to conducting research, potentially using the LLM for information gathering and summarization.
* `writeAnalysisTask`: A task related to writing an analysis, probably utilizing the LLM for content generation.
* `illustrationPromptsTask`: A task responsible for generating prompts for illustrations, which could be passed to the `illustratorAgent`.
* `finalReviewTask`: A task for conducting a final review, possibly involving multiple agents and relying on the LLM for text generation and analysis.

**tools.py**

* `SerperDevTool`: A tool for scraping search engine results, potentially used by the `researcherAgent`.
* `pdfTool`: A tool for working with PDF files, which might be used by any agent that handles PDF files.
* `txtFileTool`: A tool for working with text files, which could be used by any agent that processes text.

This organization makes it easier to manage the various components and agents in the system, and you can create additional agents, tasks, and tools as needed.
