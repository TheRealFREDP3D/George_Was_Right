# George_Was_Right - v0.3

## /main.py - File Overview

This Python code sets up a team of AI agents to analyze modern news events using themes from George Orwell's book "1984". Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Setup

1. **Libraries and Tools**:
   - Several libraries and tools are imported, including `rich` for printing, `os` for operating system functionalities, `crewai` for AI-related tasks, and `dotenv` for managing environment variables.
   - The `openai` library is included, which usually indicates functionality related to AI models.
   - Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file to configure the application without hardcoding sensitive information.

2. **Language Model Configuration**:
   - A language model is initialized using the `LLM` class from `crewai`. The model used is specified as `"github/gpt-4o"`, with a temperature setting of `0.3` that controls randomization in AI responses.

3. **Search Tool Configuration**:
   - The `SerperDevTool` is configured for searching the internet based on environment variables for country and the number of results.

### Agents

The script defines three types of agents, each with specific roles:

- **ResearcherAgent**: Focuses on finding and comparing real-world news with themes from "1984". Allows task delegation.
  
- **WriterAgent**: Gathers examples of news stories that could be directly from "1984", writing articles that compare and contrast these events with Orwell's themes. Also allows task delegation and logs outputs to a specified file.
  
- **IllustratorAgent**: Responsible for creating visual concepts based on prompts. Doesn't allow task delegation but provides verbose output for better insights.

Each agent is initialized with specific attributes like `role`, `goal`, and `backstory`.

### Crew Creation

- The `create_crew()` function prepares a `Crew` object consisting of the defined agents. It assigns tasks to each agent:
  
  - **Research Task**: Research real-world events related to "1984".
  - **Writer Task**: Write detailed comparisons of selected news and "1984" themes.
  - **Illustrator Task**: Create illustration prompts for both current events and "1984" themes.

- It returns the fully prepared crew, including tasks, with verbose mode enabled and planning support using the LLM model.

### Execution

- The `main()` function creates this crew, kicks off the task execution, and finally prints a message indicating completion.

This structure allows for extensible development and task execution in a structured team format for AI-driven analysis and output generation related to classic literature themes.
